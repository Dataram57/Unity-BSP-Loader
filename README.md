# Unity-BSP-Loader
## About
This is a newer version of my old [Unity-BSP-Loader](https://github.com/Dataram57/Unity/tree/main/Tools/BSPLoader). As same as previously, this tool is made to make mapping for unity become easy. So this tool is not designed to just simply import your Quake map, but it can be used as such.
## Mapping workflow
1. You make your map in your special level-editor (Currently preferable is Trenchbroom).
2. Your map file is being compiled into ".bsp" format.
3. Unity-BSP-Loader imports your level into your currently opened Unity scene.
## Mapping with Trenchbroom
If you are not already familiar with this program, and you don't have any alternative tool in mind to create your Quake-like level, then it would be good for you to start using Trenchbroom. Tutorial is [here](https://youtu.be/gONePWocbqA).

Also if you don't want to buy the original Quake game to test your map, then you can use a free and legal Quake-like game called [LibreQuake](https://github.com/MissLav/LibreQuake). Or you may find a legal Quake1 demo... somewhere...
## Co-operate with Trenchbroom
To improve your mapping productivity, it would be good if you wouldn't have to switch between more than windows. That's why it is preferable to replace your current compiling BSP GUI window with inside Trenchbroom tools/scripts. To compile your map you will need programs such as "qbsp" and "vis". You can download them, for example [here](https://ericwa.github.io/ericw-tools/), but it is up to you which one you will use.

...nahhh, will write later :)
